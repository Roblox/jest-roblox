# TestEZ Changelog

## Unreleased Changes
* Remove the `try` node type.
  * Remove the `step` alias for `it` since that's meant for use with `try`.
* Remove the `include` global function.
* Remove `HACK_NO_XPCALL`. With recent changes to the definition of xpcall, this is no longer necessary. Since people are still using it, it will now print out a warning asking them to delete that call instead.
* Major changes to the internals of test planning.
  * The major visible change is that `describe` and `it` blocks with duplicate descriptions will now not overwrite the earlier copies of those nodes.
  * TestPlanBuilder was removed from the API.
* Fixed a bug with how `beforeAll` and `afterAll` handled nested nodes.

## 0.2.0 (2020-03-04)
* Added support for init.spec.lua. Code in this file is treated as belonging to the directory's node in the test tree. This allows for lifecycle hooks to be attached to all files in a directory.
* Added TestEZ CLI, a Rust tool that bundles TestEZ and Lemur, and can run tests via Lemur or Roblox-CLI ([#61](https://github.com/Roblox/testez/pull/61))

## 0.1.1 (2020-01-23)
* Added beforeAll, beforeEach, afterEach, afterAll lifecycle hooks for testing
	* The setup and teardown behavior of these hooks attempt to reach feature parity with [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/setup-teardown).


## 0.1.0 (2019-11-01)
* Initial release.
