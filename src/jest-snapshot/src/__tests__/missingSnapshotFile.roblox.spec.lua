-- ROBLOX FIXME START: we can't call toMatchSnapshot and expect it to fail as this would affect the test state
it.skip("tests that a missing snapshot file throws", function()
	expect(function()
		expect(nil :: any).toMatchSnapshot()
	end).toThrow(
		"Snapshot name: `tests that a missing snapshot file throws 1`\n\nNew snapshot was [1mnot written[22m. The update flag must be explicitly passed to write a new snapshot.\n\nThis is likely because this test is run in a continuous integration (CI) environment in which snapshots are not written by default."
