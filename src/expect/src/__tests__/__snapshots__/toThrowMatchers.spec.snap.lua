-- ROBLOX upstream: https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/v27.4.7/packages/expect/src/__tests__/__snapshots__/toThrowMatchers.test.ts.snap

-- ROBLOX deviation: We don't print 'Thrown value:' or 'Received value:' for strings
-- we print 'Received message:' since the treatment of
-- string errors is the same as Error polyfill errors for us

-- ROBLOX deviation: For upstream snapshots that throw a primitive error, our version
-- of the snapshot has a stack trace included since our toThwoMatchers will
-- output a stack trace regardless of the kind of error thrown
