    I copied this folder into here for testing purposes.

    Specifically, one of the unit tests tries to serialise this folder, and
    saves the result to a snapshot. If the snapshot changes, the test fails.

    So if you touch this folder, you'll break that test.

    Apart from that, nothing in here does anything meaningful.
