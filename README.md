	BDD-style Roblox Lua testing framework

TestEZ can run within Roblox itself, as well as inside [Lemur](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/Lemur) for testing on CI systems.

## Usage

### Method 1: Installation Script (Roblox)
* Download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Roblox/TestEZ/releases).
* Use the 'Run Script' menu (located in the Test tab) to locate and run this script.
* Follow the instructions in the installer

This installation script is generated by a tool called [rbxpacker](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rbxpacker).

### Method 2: Filesystem (Roblox)
If building a Roblox place by importing scripts from the filesystem, copy the `lib` directory into your project and use a plugin like [rbxfs](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rbxfs) to synchronize the filesystem into a Roblox place.

### Method 3: Lemur (CI Systems)
You can use [Lemur](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/Lemur) paired together with a regular Lua 5.1 interpreter to run tests written with TestEZ.

This is the best approach when testing Roblox Lua libraries using existing continuous integration systems like Travis-CI. We use this technique to run tests for [Rodux](https://github.com/Roblox/Rodux).
